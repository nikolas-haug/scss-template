                            Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long
                            precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and
                            nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I
                            would sail about a little and see the watery part of the
                            world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
                            regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself
